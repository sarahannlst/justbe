## User Test Plan - includes setup, goals, and expected outcomes
Please check out our user test plan [here](https://github.com/StanfordCS194/win25-Team13/wiki/Midpoint-User-Test-Plan)
## Surprises and Validations, Data Collected
* Users are immediately skeptical of limited chronic pain selection options.
* Users want the ability to visualize not just frequency but also duration of symptoms.
* Logging was generally considered convenient, but users questioned whether they would remember to log regularly.
* Users expressed interest in seeing their medical data in different formats, particularly quantitative reports and charts.
* Bugs were found in the view charts page, and there was an error when logging.
* Editing previous logs were requested.
* Security of data was an important concern.
## Explanation and Commentary
* The UI is generally clean and intuitive but has some usability bugs and confusion around certain features.
* Users appreciated the color scheme and were curious about how charts would look.
* The ability to track pain correlations and trends was highly valued.
* Some users preferred shorter log entries, while others felt more detail might be useful.
* Users wanted a reminder system to help them log consistently.
* There is an opportunity to improve how symptom intensity and context are recorded and visualized.
## Conclusions and Actions
### What did we do well:
* Developed an intuitive and visually appealing UI.
* Provided a streamlined logging process.
* Captured user interest in symptom tracking and medical communication.
* Created a solid foundation for visualizing health data.
### What did we learn:
* Users value symptom tracking but need reminders to log consistently.
* Different users have different needs for detail in log entries.
* Security concerns must be addressed to increase trust in the platform.
* Users want flexible and meaningful data visualization options.
* Bug fixes and feature refinements are needed to improve usability.
### Target Audience Feedback:
* Target audience had most reservations about the limited options of "chronic illnesses" that were listed on the onboarding page. We decided a feature for users to add their own chronic illness/condition they wanted to track would be the best course of action.
* Target audience found the complete history helpful, especially since there were symptoms they felt they had to estimate/guess on when reporting to a doctor in the past.
* Target audience raised concerns around the UI's target age demographic -- wondering how it would be received by older generations.
