Compared to our `Midpoint User Test Plan`, we conducted the following test plans and demos after all our user flows were ready.
***

## Target Audience
We are hoping to test our implementation so far with our intended audience, chronically ill users, as well as experts in healthcare for the app to be as useful as possible. This will allow us to get the most accurate feedback on how users interact with _**Just Be**_, as we expect users who want to log their symptoms will actually be using our software. 

## Welcome & Orientation
Thank you so much for testing our project today. We’re implementing _**Just Be**_, an app for people with chronic pain or illnesses where you can easily log symptoms as they happen—simply by "speaking" to the app like you would to a nurse. Our AI extracts key details like date, duration, severity, and sensation, organizing them into clear health charts and timelines.

Our app demo includes onboarding, login, recording journal entries through text inputs, displaying previous logs via history, and exporting through visual charts and pdf-format. 

For today's exercise, we need a group of volunteers for general user behavior as well as target audience and expert volunteers.

## Setup
As we do not have current plans to launch the app, we will test it in real time with users via Expo Go, a sandbox, to experiment with the app quickly. If participants have expo go installed, they can scan the QR code to try it on their device, otherwise they'll be given a device. 

Start by either signing up or logging in with our test credentials. Once logged in, please explore as you see fit, remembering to speak your thoughts out loud along the way. In our experience you should plan on about 6-8 minutes of time to explore and leave feedback, but feel free to go as long as you like if you are still finding avenues to explore and have feedback to give.”

## Feedback Mechanism
For general user testing, we will let the user play with the app, watch them use it in-person and record any comments/suggestions they make during the process and organize the feedback into categories like UI issues, functional issues, and app design issues. At the end, we'll ask for overall feedback in the form of a google form: https://forms.gle/APHbBnwBBH8GyHmb9. 

We will ask them to rate a few things:
* how intuitive does the app feel to use
* how convenient to use
* would you would use it to track your symptoms
* do you think it would be useful for our target audience

For target users (e.g. those managing chronic pain), we plan to have a minimum of 2 and maximum of 3 developers/designers facilitate the testing session. This ensures we do not overwhelm the volunteer but also record adequate data. We will follow a similar procedure as the one outline above but ask for 10-15 minutes of the volunteer's time to ask addition question and give more space for open-ended feedback and potential features they would like to see.

We'll ask target users for feedback on:
1. What would be useful to see their medical data displayed as?
2. What kinds of charts and timelines would be most helpful? 
3. What additional features or changes can be important? 
4. What key information should be captured? 

For a medical professional, we also want to ask the following questions:
1. What would doctors or nurses find important in a patient's symptom records to be updated on? 
2. How to best organize patient records to update healthcare personnels effectively?
3. What concerns do you see with patients using this app?
