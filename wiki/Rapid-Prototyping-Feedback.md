## Test plan
* **Target audience**: emphasis on chronically ill patients, potential branch out to doctors?
* Currently, we have split the work into three parts: frontend, backend, AI
  * AI: Felicity and Andrea will test prompting for the AI user input -> goal is to make sure AI is outputting **keywords**
  * Backend: Em is currently working on testing the login/profiles for app signup -> goal is to make sure user profile and their data is saved onto db
  * Frontend: Sarah and Matthew worked on Figma and are now working on testing functioning UI features -> goal is to have a functional login/signup and logging feature on the app
* The first prototype will aim for a simple login/signup feature, then flow to the journal logging feature. After the first prototype, we will ask for feedback

## Script
Imagine that you’re managing a chronic condition and have an upcoming doctor’s appointment. You try to recall how your symptoms have changed over the past few weeks, but some details feel blurry. Maybe your pain was worse last Tuesday—or was it Wednesday? This is where **Just Be** comes in.

With **Just Be**, you can easily log symptoms as they happen—simply by "speaking" to the app like you would to a nurse. Our AI extracts key details like date, duration, severity, and sensation, organizing them into clear health charts and timelines. When it’s time for an appointment, you can generate a structured report to share with your doctor, ensuring that nothing important gets lost in memory gaps

We're currently testing early prototype iterations, and we're primarily looking for feedback on the user experience. How easy is it to log symptoms? Does the AI capture the right details? Your input will help us refine **Just Be** into a seamless and reliable tool for chronic illness management.

## Questions
* First Prototype
  * Is the UI inviting? 
  * What would you like to see when logging your symptoms?
  * What features might make the logging experience more seamless?
  * What would you like to see when you are exporting? What features would be useful compared to what exists in the market already?
  * Could you see yourself using this app to log your symptoms? What might motivate you to log your symptoms more regularly?
