# Just Be Development Guide  

## API Specifications

In order to connect to both Backend and AI API, you will need the API keys necessary for development.

The repository has an existing `.env.example` which represents the structure necessary for the dotenv file.

1. You should copy the existing `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
2. Add the API Keys - we do not want to publish these keys so please contact Andrea (andreahu@stanford.edu) for the necessary keys.



## Creating a Pull Request (PR)
