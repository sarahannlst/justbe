  * Assured FNOL: dealing with claims. Uses user's previous answers and more than 50 external data sources
  * Gradient AI: AI software solutions for the insurance industry. Claims software and underwriting software that helps manage insurance risk.
  * Cascade AI chatbot: allows users to view cost of procedures form providers while taking into account their own insurance before purchasing (this isn’t actually something that’s implemented?)
