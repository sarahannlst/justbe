## Welcome to our team's wiki! 
We're so excited to introduce you to our project! ‚öïÔ∏è

## Project Synopsis
We're building, **Just Be**, an app that helps you gain a comprehensive understanding of your health history over a long-term period. We want to enable people with chronic pain, chronic illnesses, disabilities, and other recurring conditions to manage their health and better advocate for themselves at the doctor's office.
