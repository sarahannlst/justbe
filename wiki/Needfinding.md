Insights:
* There seems to be a disconnect between doctor and patient where patients can't accurately describe their symptoms/experiences.
* Some patients face doubt from their care team and feel unheard by their doctor.
* Interviewees with chronic pain have difficulty keeping track of their condition while simultaneously juggling life and managing the illness itself.
* There were concerns with language barriers limiting access to healthcare, in both medical professional jargon and across different languages.       
***

Future Vision:
* Shift our scope to become narrower, focusing on patients who experience chronic conditions.
* Prioritize the patient's understanding of their own health on a day-to-day basis and looking back long-term.
* Equip the user with tools to better communicate with their healthcare team.
